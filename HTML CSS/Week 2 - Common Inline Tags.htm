    <title>Week 2 - Common Inline Tags</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Some common inline tags</h1>
    <main>
        <h2>Citing a source cite</h2>
        <p>The &lt;cite&gt; element makes it much easier for people and bots to search the code for specific information.</p>

        A great reference for these and other elements is <cite>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/</cite>
        <hr>
        <h2>Defining your abbreviations - abbr</h2>
        <p>The &lt;abbr&gt; element will display an abbreviation on the 
browser.  Usually it will use the title attribute which will generate an
 underline and also provide a full definition of the accronymn when 
someone hovers over the word.  If you can, put your mouse over the WD4E 
below.</p> 
        <abbr title="Sun">Sunday</abbr>, <abbr title="Mon">Monday</abbr>, <abbr title="Tues">Tuesday</abbr>, etc.<br>
        <p>Screen readers will read out the text, but don't forget that 
not everyone uses a mouse to navigate a page!!   So it is always a good 
idea to define your acronyms somewhere in the text as well.</p>
        
        <hr>

        <h2>Specifying the use of time - time</h2>
        The &lt;time&gt; element is again a completely semantic tag - it
 does not change any of the styling but it can allow systems to know to 
associate it with a calendar.<br>

        <p>"The concert took place on <time datetime="2001-05-15T19:00">May 15</time>."</p> may look like regular text, but look at the code used to generate it:<br>
        
        <p>The concert took place on &lt;time datetime="2001-05-15T19:00"&gt;May 15&lt;/time&gt;</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>Identifying code fragments - code</h2>
        <p>The &lt;code&gt; element is often displayed in a different 
font, but also some (just a little)  semantic meaning.  You can use this
 tag or later you can use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to style anything to look more like computer code.</p>

    

        <hr>

        <hr>
        <h2>Using subscripts and superscripts - sub and sup</h2>
        <p>The &lt;sub&gt; and  &lt;sup&gt; element are used to create the super and subscripts, e.g, H<sub>2</sub>0 or 1<sup>st</sup>. <br>  In the past people would often use images to display mathematical formulas, but those images weren't always accessible.<br></p>
