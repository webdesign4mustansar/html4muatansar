    <h1>Some specialized tags</h1>
    <main>
        <h2>button</h2>
        <p>Here is an example of the button tag.  It is a little bit 
misleading since it is a button that doesn't do anything.  You would 
want to add some interactivity, perhaps with JavaScript. </p>

        <button>open</button><br>
        <button>close</button>

        <hr>
        <h2>meter</h2>
        <p>he &lt;meter&gt; element is cool and can take a lot of 
attributes.  But again it is better if you have some code that can make 
the attribute values dynamic instead of "hardcoding" them.  When you 
think of a meter, think of a final score for a test.</p>

        <meter min="0" max="100" value="50%">50%</meter><br>
        <meter min="0" max="1" value=".25%">25%</meter><br>
        <meter min="5" max="10" value="8">60%</meter><br>

        <hr>
        <h2>progress</h2>
        <p>The &lt;progress&gt; element has a very similar layout to the
 meter tag.  The difference is that there is an assumption that there 
will be a progression toward 100%.  This tag is often used when filling 
out a form that has many pages of questions.</p>

        <progress value="70" max="100">70%</progress><br>

        <hr>

        <h2>iframe</h2>
        <p>The &lt;iframe&gt; element is used to next content.  It is 
not supported equally well by all browsers.  You will want to explore 
options such as width and height. </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Bi-directional orientation - bdo</h2>
        <p>The &lt;bdo&gt; element is for bi-directional orientation of 
your text.  This element can be used to change the direction of your 
text.</p>
        <p><bdo =="" "rtl"="">This text will be right to left</bdo></p>

    </main>
