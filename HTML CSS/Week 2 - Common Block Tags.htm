    <title>Week 2 - Common Block Tags</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Some common block tags</h1>
    <main>
        <h2>hr</h2>
        The &lt;hr&gt; element creates a horizontal line in most 
browsers.  It has a semantic meaning as well though as a type of break. 
 I will be using it often to up example filess when I want to display 
multiple tags in one file.

        <hr>
        <h2>address</h2>
        The &lt;address&gt; element indicates that the text is a 
specific address, perhaps contact information for the author, eg, <br>

        <address> 1715 Walnut Blvd<br>Ashtabula, OH 44004</address>

        <hr>
        <h2>blockquote</h2>
        The &lt;blockquote&gt; element is used for extended quotations. 
 It is often paired with the the cite attribute in order to show or link
 the source of the quote.

       <blockquote cite="Python for Informatics: Exploring Information: Exploring Information">“If
 something seems particularly hard, there is usually no value in staying
 up all night and staring at it. Take a break, take a nap, have a snack,
 explain what you are having a problem with to someone (or perhaps your 
dog), and then come back to it with fresh eyes. - Charles Severance”</blockquote> 
    
        <hr>
        <h2>details</h2>
        The &lt;details&gt; element is used in conjunction with the 
&lt;summary&gt;  tag and is used to hide/show content.  It is one of the
 tags that was created in response to the repeated using of scripting 
tags.<br>

        <details>
            <summary>Click here to hide/show the additional content.</summary>
  On most browsers clicking on the symbol next to the summary word or 
phrase will cause this text to appear/disappear.  On rare occasions if 
the details tag isn't supprted, the text is always shown.
        </details>

        <hr>
